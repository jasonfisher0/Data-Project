The following data was sourced from a Kaggle dataset that focused on the broad topic of Alzheimer's disease. The variables used in these analyses were chosen to examine the association between Alzheimer's and physical functioning. The plots on the succeeding pages explore the validity of the \"base plot\" by acknowledging the potential confounding variables of age and gender. Overall there appears to be a strong association between and Alzheimer's and physical function. People with lower physical function had higher percentages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy email: jasonfisher2025@gmail.com\n\nMy GitHub repo for this project: <https://github.com/jasonfisher0/Data-Project>\n\nCourse homepage: <https://bootcamp.davidkane.info>",
