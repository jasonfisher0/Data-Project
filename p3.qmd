The ages of the patients in this study ranged from 60 to 90. The continuous age variable was dichotomized, <75 vs. >= 75.The amount of people younger than 75 and those above 75 was approximately equal. The following graph shows the percentage of those with Alzheimer's is similar across age for lower functioning patients and for higher functioning patients. 


```{r}

library(ggplot2)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

# Load your data
data <- read.csv('alzheimers_disease_data.csv')

# Create a new age group variable
data <- suppressMessages(data %>%
  mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(Age < 75, "Below 75", "75 and above")))

# Create a new FunctionalAssessment group variable
data <- suppressMessages(data %>%
  mutate(FunctionalAssessmentGroup = cut(FunctionalAssessment, 
                                         breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1), 
                                         right = FALSE, 
                                         labels = c('0-1', '1-2', '2-3', '3-4', '4-5', '5-6', '6-7', '7-8', '8-9', '9-10'))))

# Summarize the data to calculate the percentage of people with AD for each combination of FunctionalAssessment group and AgeGroup
data_summary <- suppressMessages(data %>%
  group_by(FunctionalAssessmentGroup, AgeGroup) %>%
  summarise(Percent_AD = mean(Diagnosis) * 100, .groups = 'drop')) # Adding .groups='drop' to handle the message

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = FunctionalAssessmentGroup, y = Percent_AD, fill = AgeGroup)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Percent of People with Alzheimer's by age",
       x = "Functional Assessment Score",
       y = "Percentage with AD",
       fill = "Age Group") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100))
