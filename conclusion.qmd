There appears to threshold physical function score that discriminates between high and low prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease. A possible reason for the sharp drop in percentage of people with Alzheimer's after the 4-5 bin could be due to the design of the functional assessment test. The criteria for scores greater than 5 could be significantly more difficult for an individual with Alzheimer's disease to meet than those of scores less than 5.

In conclusion, higher functional assessment scores correlated with lower percentages of patients with Alzheimer's disease and lower functional assessment scores correlated with higher percentages of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
